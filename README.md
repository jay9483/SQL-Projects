# SQL Data Analytics Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my SQL Data Analytics Portfolio repository! This collection showcases my SQL skills through various data analysis projects. Each project demonstrates my ability to work with databases, write complex queries (Upto an intermediate level), perform data transformations, and derive meaningful insights from raw data.

##  Technical Skills
- **Database Management**: MySQL, SQL Server
- **SQL Proficiency**: Complex queries, joins, CTEs, window functions, aggregations
- **Data Analysis**: Trend analysis, performance metrics, comparative studies
- **Data Visualization**: Results preparation for visualization tools
- **Optimization**: Query performance tuning and efficiency
